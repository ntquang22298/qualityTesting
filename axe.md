Designed to work with existing testing infrastructure
Runs locally, no connection to a third-party server is necessary
Performs violation checking on multiple levels of nested iframes
Provides list of rules and elements that passed accessibility checking, ensuring rules have been run against entire document
Only checks rendered content to minimize false positives (that includes visually-hidden content)
